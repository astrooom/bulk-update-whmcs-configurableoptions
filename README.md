This simple script is useful for setting pricing per unit on configurable options, where the first configurable option value should be defined by the main products' pricing.

An example use-case is if you want to sell Minecraft Servers and primarily base the pricing on the GBs of RAM. The script allows you to easily define the "cost per GB" between a min and a max GB value (for example, you want to sell 2GB - 24GB RAM and all numbers inbetween). You can replace "GB" with any other units such as "slots".

The script lets you easily define the pricing per billing cycle and automatically takes care of calculating the currency rates without having to trigger the often slow currency rate updater within https://whmcs.example/admin/configcurrencies.php.
